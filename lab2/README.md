First I have drawn scatter plots and histograms to the vehicle data.

For current fleet I got the graph as 
![logo](./current_fleet.png?raw=true)
For new fleet I got the graph as
![logo](./new_fleet.png?raw=true)


After that I have developed bootstrap code in which I have calculated the mean, upper and lower bounds of the data.

For current fleet I got the graph as 
![logo](./bootstrap_confidence_current_vehicles.png?raw=true)
For new fleet I got the graph as
![logo](./bootstrap_confidence_new_vehicle.png?raw=true)

And then I have found upper and lower bound to the vehicle data. Through that I have found that new fleet is better compared the current fleet as it has more mean.
